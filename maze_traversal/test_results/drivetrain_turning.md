# Drivetrain Turning

**Test Description**: We made the robot perform four 90Â° rotations repeated ten times to be able to
extract an average of how exact the drivetrain rotation function is, and whether it becomes more or
less accurate with a change in speed.

| **Velocity** [%] | **Absolute Angle Difference** [degree] |
| - | - |
| 30 | 0.49175 |
| 50 | 0.6845 |
| 70 | 0.5005 |

**Conclusion**: The accuracy in turning to a specific heading will most likely no be a noticeable
issue at any rotation speeds. Thus, we should set the rotation speed as high as possible.
(Sidenote: At higher speeds, the robot did have to counter-correct its rotation due to overshooting
its goal. This extra step might outweigh any performance gained in making the robot perform the
primary rotation faster.)
